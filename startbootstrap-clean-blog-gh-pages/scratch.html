                    <h2>My snowboarding journey.</h2>
                    <p>Coming from a tropical country, taking a snow sports class was almost a no-brainer while studying at BYU - a campus nestled at the base of the incredible Wasatch Mountain Range, in the state known for the greatest snow on earth. I decided on snowboarding and started in January of 2025. The rest is history.</p>
                    <h2>What I love about it.</h2>
                    <p>There’s something magical about being on the mountain. The cold air breezing on your side as you cruise down the slopes, the fresh powder rustling beneath your board. Freedom.</p>

                    <h2>My dream snowboarding spots.</h2>
                    <ol>

                                <li>Famous for its light, dry powder, Niseko offers some of the best snowfall in the world, averaging over 15 meters per season. Skiers are drawn to its wide open runs, tree glades, and easily accessible backcountry terrain. The area's natural hot springs (onsen) provide a perfect way to relax after a day on the slopes. Its vibrant international village scene makes Niseko a unique blend of Japanese culture and global ski vibes.</li>
